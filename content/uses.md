## Software
I use ([Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org)) with
[Sway](https://swaywm.org/) (Tiling Window Manager) configured to set
all windows to floating mode.

- [Firefox](https://mozilla.com/firefox/), a web browser.
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), a text editor, using Vi keybindings.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), terminal text editor for quick edits.

### Configurations
I put my Emacs configuration up at
[this sourcehut repository](https://git.sr.ht/~fkinos/emacs).

## Hardware
Using a moderately powerful notebook, looking to replace it with something slower.
Using a 100% keyboard I bought some day 5 years ago and any mouse with 3 buttons.
