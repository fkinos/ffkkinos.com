_NEXTSPACE_ is a desktop environment that brings a _NeXTSTEP_ look and feel for linux. It's not just a theme or set of default applications, it includes frameworks, mouse cursors, fonts, etc.

You can learn more about it on its [Github page](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace)!

## Building Applications

When developing for NEXTSPACE we will make use of _Project Center_ and _GORM_, _Project Center_ is where we will create/edit the source code, build our applications and debug them. _GORM_ is where we will create/edit the user interface of our applications, it makes heavy use of direct manipulation and makes building interfaces pretty easy and fun!

After launching _Project Center_ we can go to _File > Create Project_ to create a new project.
