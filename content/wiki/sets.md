A sets is a collection of mathematical objects. The order doesn't matter and we ignore duplicates.

We write sets as a comma-separated list surrounded by curly braces.

This is some set { 1, 2, 3 } containing the objects 1, 2, and 3.

This is another set { a, b, b, c, a } containing the objects a, b, c.

We can also name our sets, by convention we usually start with the letters A, B, C, and so on.

## Elements

To say that some object x is an element of A is to say that x can be found in the collection A.

We denote it by x is an element of A or x is in A or x&in;A.

Alternatively, we could say that x is *not* an element of A or x&notin;A.

## Operations on Sets

Consider two sets, A = { 1, 2, 3} and B = { 3, 4, 5 }.

We can perform operations on them, each operation yielding a new set.

### Union

The union operator creates a new set containing objects that are either on A or on B.

So this new set would have the objects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as its elements.

We denote it by A *union* B or A&cup;B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }.

### Intersection

The intersection operator creates a new set containing object common to both A and B.

So this new set would only have the object 3 as its element since it's the only object in both sets.

We denote it by A *intersection* B or A&cap;B = { 3 }.

### Difference

The difference operator creates a new set with all elements of A but removing any elements that are also in B.

So this new set would have the objects 1, and 2. Removing 3 since it's also an element of B.

We denote it by A *difference* B or A&setminus;B = { 1, 2 }.
