Throughout most of our mathematical carrers while studentents we don't necessarily know why or how mathematics works, it just does.

We can deepen our understanding of mathmatics by learning to write and read proofs, mathematical arguments used to convince other mathematicians that some conclusion is true by the use of logic.

To write and read proofs we need a good deal of natural language (english, portuguese, and so on), [Mathematical Logic](/wiki/logic), and a bit of [Naive Set Theory](/wiki/sets).

## Proof Techniques

### Direct Proof

When proving some goal of the form Pâ†’Q (P implies Q, or If P, then Q) we can assume P and use it to prove Q.

Let's see this in action with the following example.

**Theorem**. Let a and b be integers. If a and b are even, then a+b is even.

After encountering a theorem we can do some scratch work, essentially a bunch of arguments in no particular order trying different things to try to come closer to what the theorem asks.

*Scratch Work*

It would be pretty difficult trying to prove a number is even without even knowing what an even number is, so let's get this out of our way.

An even number is some number x such that x equals 2k for some integer k. In other words, a number is even if it can be represented by some other number multiplied by 2.

And looking at the theorem, it tells us that both a and b are even, that means that both a and b can be represented by some number multiplied by 2.

Let's see if by substituting a and b by this other representation can help us somehow.

So a=2m for some integer m and b=2n for some integer n. That means that a+b=2m+2n, we can factor out an 2, giving us a+b=2(m+n).

From the definition of an even number, m and n must be integers, so their sum is also an integer.

Therefore a+b=2k where k=m+n, this means that a+b is can also be represented by some number multiplied by 2, in other words, a+b is an even number.

After figuring out all of this we are ready to prove this theorem.

**Proof**. Suppose a and b are even. That means a=2m for some integer m, and b=2n for some integer n. So a+b=2m+2n=2(m+n). Thus a+b=2k where k=m+n and k is an integer. Therefore, if a and b are even, then a+b is even.

The proofs themselves are way more concise and don't include a lot of the details, that's why it's important to learn to write them ourselves.
