Why take the time to learn something without pratical use?

We don't need to learn to cook, we can buy food from somewhere.

We don't need to learn to knit, we can buy clothes from somewhere.

We don't need to learn how to create, we can consume from somewhere.

What we create might be inpractial but we love it,
we don't care if it will be useful nor efficient.

We just find it beautiful.

Find the beauty in your inpractical persuing,
be it food, clothes, paintings, [computer programs](/wiki/lisp), [mathematical theorems](/wiki/proofs),
and anything in between and share it with others.
